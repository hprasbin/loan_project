# loan_project
This project defines whether the SBA should offer the loan or not.

The original data is imported from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirbektoktogaraev/should-this-loan-be-approved-or-denied. Eventhough, they offer their model in an articleI decided to build my own model with the same target.
