# loan_project
This project defines whether the SBA should offer the loan or not.

The original data is imported from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirbektoktogaraev/should-this-loan-be-approved-or-denied. Here I apply 5 models for the data and make comparisson based on recall values.

The model is originally run using python in Google Colab.
